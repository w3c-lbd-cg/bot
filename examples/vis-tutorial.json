            "The purpose of this app is to visualise and communicate the capabilities of the [Building Topology Ontology (BOT)](https://github.com/w3c-lbd-cg/bot). By default the data samples are queried as an in-memory graph using the [rdflib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rdflib) library, but unfortnately this library has its shortcomings in terms of SPARQL capabilities. We therefor recommend running it on a [Stardog](https://www.stardog.com/) based endpoint.",
            "### Use a Stardog triplestore",
            "To use the app with a Stardog tripestore this must either be available online, or this app must be run in a local environment. To do the latter, simply clone the repository, install the dependencies with `npm install` (requires [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)) and run a development server with `ng serve` (requires [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/)).",
            "With a local copy of the app running, make sure you have a Stardog running (defaults to port 5820) with an empty database (let's call it 'test'), so that you don't delete anything important. Then click the \"Switch to triplestore\" button and type in \"http://localhost:5820\" as endpoint and \"test\" as database. If you haven't changed the username and password they both default to \"admin\"."

            "The default query is a \"CONSTRUCT\" query which returns a force graph with the full dataset. Changing \"`CONSTRUCT`\" to \"`SELECT *`\" will tell the system to instead return a table displaying the query results. If you change. `CONSTRUCT WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }` to `SELECT * WHERE { ?s a bot:Space }` it will return all the space instances in the dataset.\n",

            "A SPARQL query consists of triples (subject, predicate, object) to be matched, and by adding `?` as a suffix the triple component becomes a variable that will match anything.\n",

            "A triple ends with (`.`), but if using (`;`) the first component of the triple will be reused in the next statement. \"`?s ?p ?o ; ?key ?value .`\" will therefore be interpreted the same as \"`?s ?p ?o . ?s ?key ?value .`\". (`,`) will repeat both the subject and the predicate of the previous triple, so \"`?s rdf:type bot:Space , bot:Zone .`\" is equal to \"`?s rdf:type bot:Space . ?s rdf:type bot:Zone .`\".\n",
